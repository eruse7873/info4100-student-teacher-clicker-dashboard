This project is about developing a learning analytics dashboard based on clicker data. We created a dashboard using R Shiny.

The dashboard is built off of two datasets:

1. Experience Dataset
    This dataset contains one record per student who completed the CS course between 2016-2018. Students self-reported their skill level for various kills the first week of class. 
3. Quiz Dataset
    This dataset contains one record per student per class session held where iClickers were used.
